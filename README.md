## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.


**To do this challenge you need a basic understanding of HTML and CSS.**

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design to work to.

The designs are in JPG static format. This will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. This should help train your eye to perceive differences in spacings and sizes.


You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file, which contains the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

## Giving feedback


This challenge is completely free. Please share it with anyone who will find it useful for practice.

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
